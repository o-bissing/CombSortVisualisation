Exam replacement â€“ research paper
Topic: Combsort algorithm with step-by-step visual output and runtime analysis
This program is created by Oleg Bissing, student of HTW Dresden, Matr.-Nr.: 47309
With help of this program user can:
    - give numbers to sort and print them sorted with the calculation time;
    - give a quantity of numbers to generate and print calculation time only;
    - give a quantity of numbers to generate and print them sorted with the calculation time;
    - give a quantity of numbers to generate and print all the steps of calculation for comb sort only;
    - conduct an autotest of comb sort and bubble sort algorithms.
